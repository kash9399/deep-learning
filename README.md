TensorFlow: TensorFlow provides a collection of workflows to develop and train models using Python or JavaScript, and to easily deploy in the cloud, on- prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use. The If. data API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces.

Numpy: NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): NLTK is a toolkit build for working with NLP in Python. It provides us various text processing libraries with a lot of test datasets. A variety of tasks can be performed using NLTK such as tokenizing, parse tree visualization, etc.

Pandas: Pandas is mainly used for data analysis. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL database tables or queries, and Microsoft Excel.

Scikit-Learn: Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.

Keras: Keras is used for creating deep models which can be productized on smartphones. Keras is also used for distributed training of deep learning models. Keras is used by companies such as Netflix, Yelp, Uber, etc.

PyTorch: PyTorch is designed to provide good flexibility and high speeds for deep neural network implementation. PyTorch is different from other deep learning frameworks in that it uses dynamic computation graphs.

MlPack: mlpack is a machine learning software library for C++, built on top of the Armadillo library and the ensmallen numerical optimization library. mlpack has an emphasis on scalability, speed, and ease-of-use.

OpenCV: OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more. It supports multiple languages including python, java C++.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy. As such, it offers a viable open source alternative to MATLAB. Developers can also use matplotlibâ€™s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to embed plots in GUI applications.
